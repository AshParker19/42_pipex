_This project is the introduction to the pipes in C. The goal is to create a program that will execute the command line arguments in two different processes and redirect the output of the first process to the input of the second process._

##```The new concepts of this project are:
* pipes
* fork
* processes
* redirections
* duplication of file descriptors
* environment```

##```The allowed functions are:```
| Function | Functionality |

| ```fork``` | create a child process |
| ```execve``` | execute program |
