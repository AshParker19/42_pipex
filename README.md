_This project is the introduction to the pipes in C. The goal is to create a program that will execute the command line arguments in two different processes and redirect the output of the first process to the input of the second process._

## ```The new concepts of this project are```:
* pipes
* fork
* processes
* redirections
* duplication of file descriptors
* environment

## ```The functions that I used are:```
| Function | Functionality |
| --- | --- |
| ```access``` | check real user's permissions for a file |
| ```fork``` | create a child process |
| ```execve``` | execute program |
| ```waitpid``` | wait for process to change state |
| ```pipe``` | create pipe |
| ```open``` | open and possibly create a file |
| ```close``` | close a file descriptor |
